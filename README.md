âœ… My Experience During This Challenge
When I started this challenge, I had a clear understanding of the basic structure. I knew that I needed to use two main <div> elements and apply Flexbox with a column layout to arrange them vertically.

After finishing the basic structure, I spent some time adjusting the text styles and fonts to match the design properly. This part took me some effort, especially with font sizing and alignment. However, after some trial and error, I was able to complete the design successfully.

Once the desktop design was complete, I focused on making it responsive. I followed the mobile-first approach and adjusted the layout and font sizes for smaller screens using media queries.

One thing I struggled with was the custom font files provided in the starter template. I wasnâ€™t sure how to use the fonts from the "fonts" folder, so I decided not to use them in this project. This is an area I plan to learn more about in future projects.
